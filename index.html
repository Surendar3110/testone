    <h2>Issue: System sounds setting and Mircrosoft System performance</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Recommended Settings for Optimal Vonage ContactPad Performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
    1. Performance Settings in Microsoft Edge üîß<br>
<h1>To prevent Microsoft Edge from putting inactive tabs (such as the Vonage ContactPad) to sleep:</h1>h1><br>
1. Open Microsoft Edge.<br>
2. In the address bar, type: edge://settings/system/managePerformance<br>
3. Scroll down to "Save resources with sleeping tabs".<br>
4. Disable or uncheck the following options (if enabled):<br>
   - Save resources with sleeping tabs<br>
   - Fade sleeping tabs<br>
5. Additionally, add the Vonage URL to the "Never put these sites to sleep" list by visiting: edge://settings/system/optimizedPerformance<br>
‚úÖ These settings will help ensure the ContactPad remains active, even during periods of inactivity.<br><br>
2. Sound Settings (Windows System Settings) üîä<br>
<h1>To ensure the correct audio device is used for Vonage ContactPad and that audio alerts are functioning:</h1><br>
1. Right-click the sound icon in the taskbar and select "Sound Settings".<br>
2. Under Output, confirm that the correct speaker or headset is selected (especially for external audio devices).<br>
3. Scroll down to App Volume and Device Preferences:<br>
   - Ensure the browser (Edge or Chrome) is not muted.<br>
4. Go to More sound settings > Recording > Microphone Properties > Advanced, and uncheck both options under "Exclusive Mode", which are enabled by default.<br>
‚úÖ These steps help ensure that call alerts and ringtones are properly heard.<br>
3. Notification Pop-up Settings üîî<br>
<h1>To allow the Vonage ContactPad to display notifications:</h1>h1><br><br>
<h1>In Microsoft Edge:</h1><br>
1. Navigate to: edge://settings/content/notifications<br>
2. Ensure notifications are enabled.<br>
3. Under the "Allow" section, add the Vonage domain (e.g., https://contactpad.vonage.com) if not already listed.<br>
4. Confirm the domain is not listed under "Block".<br>
<h1>In Windows (System Settings):</h1><br>
1. Go to Settings > System > Notifications.<br>
2. Ensure notifications are enabled for the browser (Microsoft Edge or Chrome).<br>
3. Enable both notification banners and sounds.<br>
‚úÖ These settings ensure agents receive visual and audio alerts for incoming calls.<br><br>
Implementing the above adjustments should improve the stability and responsiveness of the ContactPad, helping to avoid missed calls or performance issues.<br>
